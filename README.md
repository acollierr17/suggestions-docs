# Suggestions

## Introduction

I, anthony\#8557, created the Suggestions bot with the purpose of having something easy to use and everything you could need with suggestions all in one place. And I believe this bot will achieve that whether you're a YouTuber, eSports Team owner, Minecraft Server owner or just someone who wants to easily have friends in your guild suggest different ideas.

You'll find this bot easy to use with customization. The moment you invite the bot, you'll only need to go through a couple super easy steps to get users submitting right away! You can do things such using the bot mention as a prefix for commands to setting a channel specifically for staff members to vote on!

However, I created this documentation to help you grasp the full features of the bot. You will find these docs to be updated constantly. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, then please, don't hesitate to join my Discord server via the link above!
