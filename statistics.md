# Statistics

{% hint style="info" %}
Logging of approved/rejected status of suggestions began on September 29, 2018. Any data before that \*specifically\* regarding the status of a suggestion is not logged. However, suggestion data in general, in the new database, has been logged. This explains the gap between approved/rejected suggestions and the total number of suggestions in your guild if you have had this bot in your guild for some time.
{% endhint %}

There are two different commands you can use to get the statistics of suggestions in your guild:

* `suggestions`
* `sid`

The `suggestions`command allows you to view the total number of suggestions in your guild as well as how many suggestions have been approved or rejected \(read the message above\):

The sid command allows you to view the information of a specific suggestion via their suggestion ID \(sID\). You can do this with `sid <id>`:

Similar to when a suggestion is approved or rejected, the message embed will change to indicate how that suggestion was handled:

This is not where it stops! There will be more ways in the future to view even more information for suggestions. Both for users and staff members.
